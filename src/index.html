                <p>Baroque</p>
                <p class="d1-de">Baroque music is a period or style of Western classical music from approximately 1600
                    to 1750 originated in Western Europe.This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed
                    in turn by the Classical era, with the galant style marking the transition between Baroque and
                    Classical eras. The Baroque period is divided into three major phases: early, middle, and late.
                    Overlapping in time, they are conventionally dated from 1580 to 1650, from 1630 to 1700, and from
                    1680 to 1750. Baroque music forms a major portion of the "classical music" canon, and is now widely
                    studied, performed, and listened to. The term "baroque" comes from the Portuguese word barroco,
                    meaning "misshapen pearl".Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio
                    Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry
                    Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine
                    Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Jan
                    Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Dieterich Buxtehude, and others.</p>
